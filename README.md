# MDP Gridworld Implementation

This is a simple implementation of Gridworld and its corresponding Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the class Stochastic Programming (2022-20) taught by Professor Mauricio Junca at Universidad de los Andes. We use policy iteration and linear programming to solve the task. The project is documented in spanish in the the pdf.
